# OpenID Connect session cookie chunk size.
# When using "OIDCSessionType client-cookie" the session cookie may become quite large if a lot of session
# data needs to be stored, typically the size depends on the "scopes" of information you request. To work

# Specify the names of cookies to strip from the incoming request so they are not passed

# Specify the maximum number of state cookies i.e. the maximum number of parallel outstanding
